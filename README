A breadth-first search example with path costs in PHP. Output traces the path.

--------------------------------------------

WHEN "GOAL" = J

Visited Nodes:

Cost from node S to node A: 1
Cost from node S to node B: 2
Cost from node A to node D: 3
Cost from node A to node E: 4
Cost from node B to node F: 5
Cost from node B to node G: 7
Cost from node D to node J: 6

Total Search Path Cost: 28

--------------------------------------------

WHEN GOAL = D

Visited Nodes:

Cost from node S to node A: 1
Cost from node S to node B: 2
Cost from node A to node D: 3

Total Search Path Cost: 6

--------------------------------------------


WHEN GOAL = F

Visited Nodes:

Cost from node S to node A: 1
Cost from node S to node B: 2
Cost from node A to node D: 3
Cost from node A to node E: 4
Cost from node B to node F: 5

Total Search Path Cost: 15
